<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zeta Potential Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Zeta Potential Analyzer with Particle Size</li><li>Zeta Potential Analyzer without Particle Size</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Zeta Potential Analyzer market is divided into two main types: those capable of measuring zeta potential alongside particle size and those that measure only zeta potential. Analyzers with particle size capability provide comprehensive information about both the charge and distribution of particles, which is essential for understanding stability in colloidal systems. In contrast, analyzers without particle size measurement focus solely on zeta potential, serving industries where charge characterization is critical but detailed size information is less relevant.</p></p>
